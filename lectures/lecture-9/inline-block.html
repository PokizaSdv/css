<!-- Understanding the behavior of inline, block, and inline-block elements 
Understanding the behavior of inline, block, and inline-block elements is crucial for controlling the layout and positioning of elements on a webpage. These display properties dictate how elements are rendered and how they interact with other elements within the document flow. Let's explore each of them:

Inline Elements:
Inline elements are those that flow within the text content and do not create line breaks before or after themselves. They typically occupy only the space required by their content. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <em>, <strong>, and text-level elements like <i> and <b>.

Key characteristics of inline elements:

They do not create line breaks before or after themselves.
They respect the surrounding text and flow within the text content.
They cannot have width and height properties directly applied to them.
Margins and paddings only affect the left and right sides, not the top and bottom.
Block Elements
Block elements generate line breaks before and after themselves, creating distinct blocks within the layout. They take up the full width available within their parent container by default, and their width and height properties can be directly manipulated. Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <li>, and structural elements like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.

Key characteristics of block elements:

They create line breaks before and after themselves, resulting in a new block on the page.
They occupy the full width available within their parent container by default.
They can have width and height properties applied to them.
Margins, paddings, and borders affect all four sides.
Inline-block Elements
Inline-block elements exhibit characteristics of both inline and block elements. They flow within the text content like inline elements, but they can have width, height, margins, paddings, and borders applied to them, similar to block elements. Examples of inline-block elements include <img>, <button>, <input>, and elements with display: inline-block explicitly applied.

Key characteristics of inline-block elements:

They flow within the text content and do not create line breaks before or after themselves.
They can have width, height, margins, paddings, and borders applied to them.
They respect the surrounding text and flow alongside other inline and text elements.
They allow for block-like styling while still being part of the inline flow.
By understanding the behavior of inline, block, and inline-block elements, you can strategically choose the appropriate display property to achieve the desired layout and positioning of elements on your webpage. These display properties play a crucial role in creating well-structured and visually appealing web layouts.
