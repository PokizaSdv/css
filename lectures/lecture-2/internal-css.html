<!-- Internal CSS is a way of adding CSS styles to an HTML document by including them in the head section of the HTML file, using the <style> tag. This is called Internal CSS because the CSS styles are included within the same HTML file as the content that they style.

Using Internal CSS, you can apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements in your HTML file. To do this, you add CSS rules inside the <style> tag in the head section of your HTML file.

For example, let's say you want to change the color of all the headings in your HTML file. You can do this using Internal CSS by adding a CSS rule inside the <style> tag that targets all <h2> elements:



This above CSS rule applies to all <h2> elements in an HTML document, and sets their color property to blue.

CSS Rule
The entire code block h2 { color: blue; } can be referred to as a CSS rule

Selector
What are Selectors? Selectors in CSS are used to select and manipulate HTML elements. They allow you to apply styles to elements that match certain criteria.

There are several types of selectors, such as ID, Class and Attribute, but for now, we'll focus on Element Selector which is literally a Tag name.

The h2 part of the rule is the selector(Element Selector), which selects the HTML element that you want to apply the styles to. In this case, the selector is h2, which selects all <h2> elements in the HTML document.

Declaration Block
The curly braces {} enclose the declaration block, which contains one or more declarations that define the styles you want to apply to the selected element. color: blue; is a declaration.

Property and Value
In CSS, a declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value.

The property is the aspect of the element that you want to style, such as color, background-color, font-size, etc. Each property has its own specific purpose and affects different aspects of the element.

The value is the setting or the value that you want to apply to the property. For example, if you want to set the color of the text within an element to blue, you can use the color property and set its value to blue.

So, color is property and blue is value in the example above. -->
